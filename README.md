# Balls
Which ball is different?

We have 12 balls, all are exactly the same in all respects, with a single exception. One of the balls is either slightly lighter or slightly heavier than the other 11. (And we do not know whether it is lighter or heavier). “Slightly” means that the difference is very small and you need to use an accurate weighing instrument, balance scales, to see the difference. Your task is to learn which ball is different from the others and whether it is lighter or heavier using the least possible number of weighings.
